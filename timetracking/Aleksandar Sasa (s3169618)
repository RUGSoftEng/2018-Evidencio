15.03. - started installing php
15.03. - realized I need to install Apache and MySQL
15.03. - some random YT tutorial seemd bad so I opted for the other one. was a bad decission
15.03. - started the tutorial I first opened, but now, I needed the entire playlist of them. I went over the playlist of tutorials
15.03. - after downloading everything several times and managing it I tried to run the pulled version with laravel project
15.03. - googled "install laravel" realized I have lost 2,5 hours - I found XAMPP
15.03. - deleted everything and installed XAMPP; spent few minutes in disbelief since it was this easy
15.03. - was ashamed I use Windows when comunicating what should be done with the pulled version; decided to stick with it
15.03. - managed to install everithing and get it going, but with Command Prompt.. XAMPP had nothing to do with it.. This had to be changed.. Decided to add some virtal hosts..
15.03. - too much time, I am to tired and hungry.. I hardcoded the repository directory into the XAMPP - Apache config file.. It works this way.. Finally..
